Practicing DSA using C++

Today I explored the concept of functions in C++. I’ve used main() so far, but this was the first time I properly wrote and used a custom function to handle logic separately.

I built a password strength checker, and instead of putting everything inside main(), I created a function named check() that takes a password as input and returns a string indicating its strength.

This taught me how functions can:

Encapsulate logic, making code cleaner and more organized

Accept parameters and return results

Improve reusability and make the main program flow easier to understand

While writing the function, I ran into some small issues — like how to return a meaningful response, and how to use bool flags to track the types of characters in the password (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters). I also added a condition to check for minimum password length.

Using standard library functions like islower(), isupper(), isdigit(), and separating everything into a dedicated check() function really helped make the program structured and readable.

Feeling a lot more confident about using functions now!
