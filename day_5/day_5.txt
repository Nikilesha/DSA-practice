Day 5 - 11/06/2025
Practicing DSA using C++

Today was all about conditional statements and applying logic through small real-life inspired problems.

Here’s what I practiced:

Movie Ticket Pricing

Based on age, applied different ticket prices.

Added a 20% discount if the movie time was before 5 PM (17:00).

Used nested if-else and arithmetic operations for discount logic.

Mobile Data Usage Alert

Took data usage and plan limit as input.

Used if-else conditions to give alerts like “All good”, “Caution”, or “Limit Exceeded” based on the usage percentage.

Blood Donation Eligibility

Used a ternary operator to check if age ≥ 18, weight ≥ 50kg, and hemoglobin ≥ 12.5.

Printed "Eligible" or "Not eligible" accordingly.

Traffic Signal Fine (Switch-Case Practice)

Took signal color as input (R/Y/G).

Used switch-case to simulate fine or message based on signal:

Red → ₹500 fine

Yellow → Warning

Green → Go

These helped me get comfortable with conditions, comparison operators, nested logic, and even using switch for control flow.
