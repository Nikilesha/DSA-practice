Day 2 - 06/06/2025
Practicing DSA using C++

Today I continued learning more about datatypes.
I explored how to find the size of different datatypes using the sizeof operator – it helped me understand how much memory each type takes (like int, float, double, etc.).

I also started learning about modifiers like short, long, unsigned, etc.
But to be honest, I’m not very confident about them yet.
So I’ll go through them again tomorrow to get a better understanding.
