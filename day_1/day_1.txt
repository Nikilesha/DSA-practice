Practicing DSA using C++

Today I started learning DSA using C++.
First, I learnt the basics of C++ â€“ starting with the boilerplate code like #include <iostream>, using namespace std;, and writing the main() function.
Then I explored how input and output works in C++ using cin and cout.

After that, I learnt about variables and different datatypes like int, float, double, char, and bool.
I got a basic idea of how to declare them and how they are used in simple programs.
