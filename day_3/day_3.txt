Practicing DSA using C++

Today I explored more about type conversions and memory size.

I checked the size of long int using the sizeof operator.

Practiced implicit type casting by dividing integers with floats (5/3.0, 5.0/3) to understand how C++ handles mixed-type operations.

Then I saw how characters can be manipulated by adding integers – like turning 'A' into 'B' by doing letter + 1.

Also did some explicit type conversion by casting an int to float before dividing, like this:

cpp
Copy
Edit
cout << (float)x / 3;
At the end, I declared 5 integers and tried to find their average using fixed and setprecision(4) to format the output with 4 decimal places.
Though I didn’t assign values to the variables yet, the logic part is clear.

Feeling more comfortable with type conversions now!
