Practicing DSA using C++

Today I started learning about operators in C++.

Practiced arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and / using simple variables.

Used compound assignment operators like += and -= to update variable values quickly.

Then I tried out relational operators like >, ==, and understood how they return 1 (true) or 0 (false).
Also tested post-increment and post-decrement using a++ and b--.

Finally, I explored bitwise operators like &, |, ^, and ~.
It was interesting to see how they work at the binary level.

Feeling more confident with operators now. Next, Iâ€™ll probably get into conditionals or loops.
